# Motion Comittee Test Environment

Create a symlink to this repository in `~/.opt/nrpStorage` called `Experiment_0`. Then go to `localhost:9000/#/esv-private?dev` to start it.

1. Setup the Tennis-Challenge-Environment

To use the Tennis Racket you need to put the collada file "tennis_racket_3d.dae" into the 2 folders:
~/Documents/NRP/Models/arm_robot/collisions/
and
~/Documents/NRP/Models/arm_robot/meshes/

2. TODO - let Hollie grasp the racket

To make grasping easier the gravity of the tennis racket is set to 0.
